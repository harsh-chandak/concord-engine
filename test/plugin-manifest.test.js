/**
 * Two things about the launch declaration that no other test watches, and that
 * fail without telling the author anything: the manifest stays valid JSON and
 * the plugin still installs.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted here: that a userConfig referenced in `env` must be
 * `required: true`. That rule looked certain for a while — the plugin failed to
 * connect, `decisions_dir` was optional, no pluginConfigs entry existed, and the
 * sibling plugin with a REQUIRED config connected on the same host. The
 * falsifying test was a plain host re-dial, which later succeeded with the
 * config still unset. So an unresolvable optional placeholder does not stop the
 * spawn: the host substitutes an empty value (no directory named after the
 * placeholder is ever created, and the server tolerates empty). Asserting it
 * would have frozen a disproved mechanism into the test suite.
 *
 * What the empty value DOES cause is the log landing in whatever directory the
 * server happened to start in — handled where it belongs, by reporting the
 * resolved path, not by making an optional setting mandatory.
